## Problem Statement

Many organizations receive a high volume of user feedback through forms, emails, and surveys ‚Äî yet *lack the infrastructure to categorize, respond, and route that feedback in real-time*.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This results in:
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Delays in resolving user complaints  
-  Feature requests getting lost  
-  Positive feedback not reaching the right teams

This results in:  
- Delays in resolving user complaints  
- Feature requests getting lost  
- Positive feedback not reaching the right teams  

## Solution Overview

This workflow solves that bottleneck by integrating *AI-based classification, **real-time database routing, **team collaboration, and **automated user communication* into a single seamless process.

### Key Capabilities

-  *AI Classification: Uses **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash* to detect whether feedback is a:

  - Complaint
  - Compliment
  - Feature Request

<<<<<<< HEAD
-  *Structured Storage in Airtable*:
  - Automatically logs feedback in *separate tables* based on category
  - Each record contains: name, email, feedback, classification

-  *Real-Time Slack Notifications*:
  - Sends categorized feedback to appropriate Slack channels/teams with all relevant user info

-  *Gmail API Auto-Responses*:
  - If a complaint is detected, the user receives an immediate, professional email acknowledging their concern

-  *Flexible Input Triggers*:
