# 🧠 Intelligent Feedback Segregation Workflow (n8n + AI)

An advanced automation pipeline crafted with **n8n**, **Google Gemini**, **Slack**, **Airtable**, and **Gmail API**, designed to **intelligently classify and route user feedback**. This system streamlines how organizations handle complaints, compliments, and feature requests — transforming raw user input into actionable insights, automatically.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Many organizations receive a high volume of user feedback through forms, emails, and surveys — yet **lack the infrastructure to categorize, respond, and route that feedback in real-time**.

This results in:
- 📉 Delays in resolving user complaints  
- 🧩 Feature requests getting lost  
- 🌟 Positive feedback not reaching the right teams  

---

## ✅ Solution Overview

This workflow solves that bottleneck by integrating **AI-based classification**, **real-time database routing**, **team collaboration**, and **automated user communication** into a single seamless process.

### ✨ Key Capabilities

- 🧠 **AI Classification**: Uses **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** to detect whether feedback is a:
  - Complaint
  - Compliment
  - Feature Request

- 🗃️ **Structured Storage in Airtable**:
  - Automatically logs feedback in **separate tables** based on category
  - Each record contains: name, email, feedback, classification

- 🔔 **Real-Time Slack Notifications**:
  - Sends categorized feedback to appropriate Slack channels/teams with all relevant user info

- 📧 **Gmail API Auto-Responses**:
  - If a complaint is detected, the user receives an immediate, professional email acknowledging their concern

- 🌐 **Flexible Input Triggers**:
  - Starts from an **n8n form**, but can easily be adapted to Google Forms, Microsoft Forms, or any webhook-enabled frontend

---

## 🔁 Workflow Lifecycle

1. **Form Submission** – User submits feedback (via n8n form or external webhook)
2. **AI Analysis** – Feedback content is interpreted using **Gemini 1.5 Flash**
3. **Conditional Routing**:
   - Stores in **Airtable** under the correct category table
   - Posts to **Slack** with metadata (name, email, message, type)
   - If complaint → triggers **Gmail auto-response**
